# 🔥 Featured Project

## 🧠 Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Pipeline

Built a distributed deep learning system using **TensorFlow Federated** where multiple clients train models locally and share only model updates with a central server using Federated Averaging.

### 🚀 Key Highlights
- Simulated multi-client distributed training  
- Implemented secure weight aggregation (Federated Averaging)  
- Achieved **96.7% global accuracy on MNIST**  
- Demonstrated privacy-preserving AI model training without sharing raw data  
- Designed a modular and scalable architecture for real-world distributed environments  

### 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Federated, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  

📌 Focus Areas: Distributed Learning, Privacy-Preserving AI, Deep Learning Systems
